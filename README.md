# AngeleCat

This project aims to create a Cat story game. this projects is initially a personnal gift to my girlfriend, but may also serve as a nice codebase to work with, and you may freely look at it, try it, improve it or copy it, as long as you respect its licence (see LICENCE.md)

## Code

This project is made with the Unreal Engine 4. it has started on the 4.22 and is kept up to date with the latest release as often as I can maintain it.

## Geometry, Assets and more.

All uassets belong to me. other files shouldn't be considered as mine and should'nt be used outside of this project, as they may come from other sources with different licencing (tldr. respect the relevant licence).

## How Can I use it
You just need an Unreal Engine either from Epic's source code, or from EpicGames Launcher.

## How can I help ?
You can do pull request, IÂ´ll review them and will probably merge them.
