This project aims to create a Cat story game. this projects is initially a personnal gift to my girlfriend, but may also serve as a nice codebase to work with, and you may freely look at it, try it, improve it or copy it, as long as you respect its licence (see LICENCE.md)

## Code

This project is made with the Unreal Engine 4. it has started on the 4.22 and is kept up to date with the latest release as often as I can maintain it, it is now on 4.24.

This project has multiple code modules, acting as "Plugin-like".
For your personal project you might be interested in those :
- `Cat_Character` : contains an horizontal capsule and modified movement component to work along.
- `Cat_Animation` and `Cat_Animation_Editor` : Contains a recent example of how to make custom animation nodes.

I plan to work also on :

- Custom AI.
- Simple unified interaction system.

## Geometry, Assets and more.

All uassets belong to me. other files shouldn't be considered as mine and should'nt be used outside of this project, as they may come from other sources with different licencing (tldr. respect the relevant licence).

## How Can I use it
You just need an Unreal Engine either from Epic's source code, or from EpicGames Launcher. it requieres at least version 4.24.

## How can I help ?
You can do pull request, IÂ´ll review them and will probably merge them.
You can also create plugins from this repository as long as you respect the license, and flag me as contributor (so that I can replace those modules by actual plugins).
